Question:
In our first attempt to parallelize the program for estimating π, our program
was incorrect. In fact, we used the result of the program when it was run with
one thread as evidence that the program run with two threads was incorrect.
Explain why we could “trust” the result of the program when it was run with
one thread.

Answer:
The version of the estimate pi program with one thread program will always be correct because
there will not be another thread trying to update the global sum variable.
Besides, there will be only one thread entering the critical section, so there is no change of a
race condition to happen with any other thread.
